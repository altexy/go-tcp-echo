# Go TCP echo

Basic echo server written in Go.

This is a simplest TCP server I could think of. I use it to experiment with different deployment systems and concerns, such as Docker, Heroku, Godeps and others. The app itself is dead simple, and it's functinality should be evident to any programmer from source code, no go knowledge required. All configuration files are WIP, but hopefully, they can help someone who's struggling with the same issues.
